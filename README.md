# HackerNewsStoriesAPI
A RESTFul API to interact with the Hacker News website and retrieve some of their best stories possible!

# How to run this application
There are two ways to run this API.

1. You can download the entire project onto your hard drive and then fire up Visual Studio and open up the HackerNewsStories.sln file. This will open up the project on your machine and you can then hit F5 to run the project. Your default web browser will open up and then you can test the API.
2. You can download the pre-packaged files from the Packaged Files folder and copy them to your IIS Web Server. Then you can browse to them from your default web browser.

# Future Enhancements

Given time and other incentives, I would try to implement caching and test this API with a proper ASP.NET Core website. Also I would host this API on IIS Server or other servers and test it there as well to see how much more I could improve it.
